# Floyd Warshall Algorithm with Recursion Documentation


## Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions to run the Floyd Warshall Algorithm with the use of recursion in fullfilment of the Mid-Module Assigment for Software Development in Practive for the University of Liverpool.

## Requirments
To run the provided files the following requirements must be met:

* Python (>= 3.7)
* Numpy (>= 1.18.4)
* Sys (>=3.10.2)
* Itertools (>= 8.12.0)
* Unittest (>=3.10.4)
* Timeit

Most of the packages come with a standard Python distribution, numpy can be installed with the following pip command:
```
pip install numpy
```

## Run
The starting file to run the experiments is the ``main.py``. To test the code of the ``main.py`` run ``test_floyd.py``.  Additionaly, performance test for two different implementation of the Floyd Warshall Lgorithm can be run with the file ``performance_test.py``
